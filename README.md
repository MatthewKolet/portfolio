# Professional Portfolio Website
---
> Created a website to showcase my professional portfolio.

### Professional Portfolio
A professional portfolio provides a single location for recruiters or other industry professionals to read a brief background about you, learn more about your career and general interests, and most importantly, get in touch with you. This project involved creating a Static Web App to host the html code that was created on a local desktop.

This repository was a part of my final project for Digital Product Management at The University of Iowa.

### Prerequisites
This project was created using Visual Studio Code to edit my html, css, and yml files. It also requires a Microsoft Azure account that can be linked to your GitHub account to access the repository and upload your html files to the Static Web App. The project can be further customized by linking your own domain, but it still can be completed with the sample domain created by Microsoft Azure.

### Steps to run
1. Clone this repository down to your local desktop.
2. Delete the .yml file in the GitHub Workflows folder.
3. Push the local repository to GitHub from GitHub desktop.
4. In Microsoft Azure, link your GitHub repository to the Static Web App. This should create a new .yml file that is customized to your GitHub account.
5. (Optional) If you have your own domain, add your domain name to the custom domain sections of your Static Web App and add the approriate records onto NameCheap or whichever domain hosting site you're using.
